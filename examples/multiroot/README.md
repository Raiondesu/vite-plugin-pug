# :japanese_goblin::construction_worker: _multiroot_ example :paw_prints:

The name _multiroot_ is legacy from the initial attempt to pugize multiple inputs.

## Why still a work in progress?

As the [multipage example](../multipage) shows it is quite simple to transpile pug files to html one by one. To extend that functionality it would be great to effectively use templates.

The variant above tries to become closer to a real life example. Uses `index.html` as the template and generates sitemap based on pug files folder structure.

> Running Vite dev the way to make it work **for now**.

At this point it starts to make Vite superfluous that questions the direction it’s going. Don’t hold [your idea](https://github.com/SubZtep/vite-plugin-pug/discussions/2)!

## How to try?

```bash
$ gh repo clone SubZtep/vite-plugin-pug
$ cd vite-plugin-pug
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

## ETA? :mask:
